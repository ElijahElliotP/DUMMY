This is the very first change to the document.

Another change.

This can be feature01.

I will make an important change to "main branch" and then rebase "feature_one" from it. Let's see how the conflict appears now.
The lines below were in conflict with the lines above.
I've renamed the branch using the desktop client to "feature_one" and it does not alter the branch on github (the remote) where it is still called "feature01"
